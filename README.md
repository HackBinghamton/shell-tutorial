# The Terminal
Today we will be covering the basics of using a Unix terminal. You will
learn how to navigate folders, and how to make, delete, copy, and move
files and folders.

## Why Use The Terminal?
While graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are helpful for a lot of things,
sometimes command line interfaces (CLIs) are the better tool for the job.

As an example, imagine you have a messy folder, and you want to combine
all the .txt files into a new file called "newfile.txt". If you use a
GUI, this seems like a tedious task, but it only takes one line in the
shell.
    
    cat *.txt > newfile.txt

## Where Is The Terminal?

### Mac OS
1. Open Finder from the Dock.
2. Open your Applications folder.
3. Open Utilities.
4. Double click on Terminal.

### Ubuntu
Hit the keyboard shortcut Ctrl - Alt - T.

### Windows
Windows also has a built-in terminal, Command Prompt; however, Command
Prompt differs greatly from the terminals on Mac and Linux. So you will
need to install a terminal with the same features.

In the next workshop, we will be learning the basics of git. Since Git
for Windows comes with a shell Git BASH, we recommend that you install it.

## Moving Around
Navigating folders in a GUI, you often see folders arranged like this:
